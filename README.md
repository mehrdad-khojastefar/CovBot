# Cov Bot
### Telegram bot that fetches the covid stats ( country based ) 

## Install :

install the packages required by the project
`pip install -r req.txt`

First you need to get a BOT TOKEN from @BotFather, then you have to enter your token in line 90 of the `main.py` script
```python
	# Create the Updater and pass it your bot's token.
    	updater = Updater("YOUR BOT TOKEN GOES HERE")
``` 
## How to use :
The bot understands the basic 4 commands ( even if you don't have them added in the botfather ) `/start /stop /help /menu`
After you have started the bot, enter a country name to get the inline buttons for each action.
( right now it only supports deaths and active cases )
